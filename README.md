# senbee_codetest_2_image_gallery

## Objective
Create a responsive and dynamic image gallery web application using native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Requirements

### Image Gallery
- Display a grid of image thumbnails loaded dynamically via JavaScript.
- Clicking a thumbnail opens a modal/lightbox showing the full-sized image along with its title and photographer details.
- Include next and previous buttons to navigate through images in the modal.
- A close button or click-outside event should close the modal.

### Additional Features
- Implement a light and dark theme using CSS variables and native JavaScript for toggling themes.
- Bonus: Allow candidates to showcase their creativity by designing a gallery header (e.g., logo, search bar, or filter options).

## Technical Constraints
- Use only native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks).
- Ensure the gallery is responsive across various screen sizes using CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- Write clean, readable code and make use of best practices for accessibility.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Use the provided images in the `public/images/` folder or add your own.
3. Build the application according to the requirements.

## Bonus Points
- Adding subtle animations and hover effects for a modern look.
- Implementing a search/filter function for the gallery (optional).
- Using CSS transitions for smooth opening/closing of the modal.

## Submission
Push your code to a GitHub repository and share the link.

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours (Candidates can spend more or less time as they see fit; weâ€™re more interested in quality over quantity).
